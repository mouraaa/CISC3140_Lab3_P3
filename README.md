# CISC3140_Lab3_P2

### Reminder 
I spoke to the professor and she did not have a problem that there was no input box/mask as long as there was some sort of javascript browswer listening event. I got interested in chrome extensions during lab 1 so I decided to continue on that path for this lab. 

### What's it do? 
The goal of this extension is for those who may have a difficult time reading or may even be too busy doing something else at the moment but still want to absorb  information. Think of this as an audiobook but for the whole internet. Simply highlight any text you would like to be read out loud and right click to access the context menu. Then choose 'speak it' to listen!
